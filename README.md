## Introduction

This Shiny dashboard is a tool for exploring the quantification of COVID-19 at a national level. Select variables to highlight countries and compare in-group and overall means.

Questions, suggestions, or requests for additional stats or functionalities to be added to the app can be directed to contactmspringsteen@gmail.com

## Data

COVID-19 data is updated daily to reflect any updates to [JHU's repository](https://github.com/CSSEGISandData).

COVID-19 metrics are drawn from the [Johns Hopkins CSSE COVID-19 repository](https://github.com/CSSEGISandData). Data about the [number of physicians](https://apps.who.int/gho/data/node.main.HWFGRP_0020?lang=en) and [hospital beds](https://apps.who.int/gho/data/view.main.HS07v) available per 10,000 people are from the WHO. Hand-washing data is drawn from a [WHO / UNICEF collaboration](https://washdata.org/data/downloads#WLD) on Water Supply, Sanitation, and Hygiene. Data about the percent living in poverty or in urban slums has been compiled by the [UN Millennium Development Goals](http://mdgs.un.org/unsd/mdg/Data.aspx) initiative. All other data represent the latest available country-level measure from the [World Bank](https://data.worldbank.org/).
