## Introduction

This Shiny dashboard is a tool for exploring the quantification of COVID-19 at a national level. Select variables to highlight countries and compare in-group and overall means.

Remember that visualizations like this can often tell us more about a country's testing capacity and reporting infrastructure than about the number of infections or deaths actually present at any given time.

Questions, suggestions, or requests for additional stats or functionalities to be added to the app can be directed to contactmspringsteen@gmail.com

COVID-19 data is updated daily to reflect any updates to [JHU's repository](https://github.com/CSSEGISandData). Testing data will be updated regularly to reflect changes to [Our World in Data](https://ourworldindata.org/coronavirus-testing-source-data) summaries.

## Data

COVID-19 metrics are drawn from the [Johns Hopkins CSSE COVID-19 repository](https://github.com/CSSEGISandData).
